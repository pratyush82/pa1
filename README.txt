1. Examples of Python code that does not work with this compiler:
    a. pow(2,-2)    -   This returns floating point number in Python, but in this compiler it just returns 0.
    b. print(1,2)   -   Python can print multiple things in a print statement, but this compiler returns ParseError.
    c. a,b=1,2      -   Python has multiple assignments possible in one line, but this compiler returns error.

2. TA tutorial recording was most useful along with some googling on the side!
